* Bugs
** Outline-Outshine-Navi

1.

Not reliably reproducible:
1. When a buffer has been open long enough, sometimes it will take two movements
   to traverse through collapsed headings. The extra movement jumps to the
   ellipsis.

** Magit

1. Cannot maintain new faces in commit buffers, but can keep symbol updates. 2.
2. Escaping the ivy commit prompt will make the next call to commit jump to the
   commit template without prompting. This is an issue between integrating ivy
   and magit exiting, no luck fixing. So use , k rather than ESC on a commit
   prompt to cancel a commit.

** Pretty symbols

1. The plist approach drops support for spaces in RHS of replacements that
   prettify utils added support for.
