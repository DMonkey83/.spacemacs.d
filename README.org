Closer look at my shell, ivy prompt, and neotree.

Example code showing unicode symbol replacements (the replacement is purely visual):

* My Spacemacs
My Spacemacs notably implements:
1. Visual enhancements
   1. Unicode symbol replacement for mimicking mathematical notation in
      programming buffers.
   2. Fira Code ligature integration (any font can be used in-tandem).
   3. Magit commit header fontification with ivy integration.
   4. Eshell fontification with icon integration.
2. Org-like navigation and visualization in programming buffers
   1. See 'outline-mode', 'outshine-mode', 'navi-mode'.
3. Rebound many core keybindings superfluous with leader-keys and evil.
   1. C-h, C-j, C-k, C-l are Avy motions.
   2. C-SPC for yassnippet expansion
   3. C-e eshell popup and so on...
4. Modular config organization to enable/disable components easily.

** Implementation
Literate configs with org-mode are not natively supported by Spacemacs due to
org-mode's interaction with spacemacs layers systems.

The alternative is 'outline-mode' which creates faux-headers within different
major modes based on their comment syntax. 'navi-mode' and 'outshine-mode'
expand outline mode.

These modes are improved by providing:
1. Enhanced narrowing capabilities.
2. Vim bindings and additional navigation bindings.
3. Bugfixes.

Together managing large source buffers such as an Emacs configuration becomes
pleasant.

** Version
Dual config for Windows and Arch Linux for Emacs 25.2.1
