Closer look at my shell, ivy prompt, and neotree.

Example code showing unicode symbol replacements (the replacement is purely visual):

Magit commits and logs of the form "Fix:, Add:, Docs:, etc..." are displayed with

* My Spacemacs

My Spacemacs notably implements:

1. Visual enhancements - see screens.
   1. Unicode symbol replacement for mimicking mathematical notation in
      programming buffers.
   2. Fira Code ligature integration (any font can be used in-tandem).
   3. Magit commit header fontification with ivy integration.
   4. Eshell fontification with icon integration.
2. Org-like navigation and visualization in programming buffers - see outshine.

Literate configs with org-mode are not natively supported by spacemacs
due to org-mode's interaction with spacemacs layers systems.

The approach taken is to use the `outline-minor-mode' in conjuction
with `outshine-mode' and `navi-mode' to maintain benefits of literate
documentation and org-modes navigation, collapsing, and narrowing facilities.
