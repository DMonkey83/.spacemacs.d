* My Spacemacs
My Spacemacs notably implements:
- Visual enhancements
  - Unicode symbol replacement for mimicking mathematical notation in
     programming buffers.
  - Fira Code ligature integration (any font can be used in-tandem).
  - Magit commit header fontification with ivy integration.
  - Eshell fontification with icon integration.
- Org-like navigation and visualization in programming buffers
  - See 'outline-mode', 'outshine-mode', 'navi-mode'.
- Rebound many core keybindings superfluous with leader-keys and evil
  - C-h, C-j, C-k, C-l are Avy motions.
  - C-SPC for yassnippet expansion
  - C-e eshell popup and so on...
- Modular organization to enable/disable components easily

** Implementation
Literate configs with org-mode are not natively supported by Spacemacs due to
org-mode's interaction with spacemacs layers systems.

The alternative is 'outline-mode' which creates faux-headers within different
major modes based on their comment syntax.

Outlines are improved by providing:
- Navi and outshine mode - see sections.
- Enhanced narrowing capabilities.
- Vim bindings and additional navigation bindings.
- Bugfixes.

Together, managing large source buffers such as an Emacs configuration becomes
pleasant. Further, many source files, especially Emacs lisp files, both
intentionally and unintentionally use outline compatible comments improving
their navigation and comprehensibility.

** Install

Display module requirements:
- Install [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]] fonts.
- Font-locks ligatures component requires [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code Symbol]] (Only need for the
  ligatures).

Other requirements:
- Pandoc layer requires [[http://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] installed.

That's it. I would be appreciative to hear your experience with my config.

** Version
Dual config for Windows and Arch Linux for Emacs 25.2.1
